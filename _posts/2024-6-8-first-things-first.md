## I Quit

I used to joke about making one of those tiny coffee table books collecting Tweets, forum posts, Facebook updates of people quitting the community. This kind of kiss off is somewhat cliched. Because inevitably the poster returns. Or the public message is a cry for attention and a chance to vent frustation towards their enemies, frenemies, etc. A goodbye post is one of the myriad end points of forum drama -- part of the social internet's circle of life. An inherently immature part. At least in my estimation.

So it is with more than a little irony that I embark on this undertaking. Where I outline the reasons why I have, over the last ten years or so, receded from the Internet. I've used it less. I've opted out of somewhat mandatory pieces of tech -- most notable the smart phone.

But I haven't just walked a way. I have been and continue to search for new ways to use the Internet that feel more humane. Ways that make me feel less crazy. I keep my socialiation mostly on Discord (in a future post I will explain why and outline my fears that it won't remain the least bad place to socialie online). I text via sms on a dumb phone with a very small circle of friends. 

The main thing I'd like to impress here is that I'm not an outright hater or luddite. I used to LOVE the Internet. I was all in. 

I feel the Internet isn't quite the place it used to be. I'd like to get back to that place. Or, if possible, create new places that re-capture all the best parts of the Internet and discard all the excess baggage we've accumulated the past 20 years. 

I don't claim to know all the answers. And the only authority I speak from is my own experience. I don't have a meaningful degree or job title. I didn't found a company or make a million dollars. And I don't know how to code -- which makes me an outsider in this place. 

But starting to learn how to do Internet things myself is part of this project.
